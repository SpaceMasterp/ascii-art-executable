# Source analysis and lexical boundaries (Part A)

Part A turns user text into the single artifact the rest of the pipeline trusts:
a `SourceModel` with the original text, its LF-normalized copy, the ordered raw
token stream, the original comments and the function signature. It also owns the
`can_join` decision that lets the layout stage place two tokens next to each
other without a separator. Nothing here chooses a shape, a size or a comment.

## Public interface

| Name | Signature | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analyze_source` | `(text, profile=None, *, ctx=None) -> SourceModel` | Validate one self-contained C11 function; raise `StageError` with a shared `Diagnostic` on failure. |
| `can_join` | `(run_tokens, next_token, profile=None) -> bool` | Re-lex the whole contiguous run plus the candidate and compare kinds and spellings. |
| `lex_source` | `(text, *, ctx) -> tuple[LexedToken, ...]` | Raw token adapter E reuses for the generated source. |
| `prepare_profile` | `(profile) -> VerificationProfile` | Bind A's lexer to the profile so E compares with the same lexer. |

`codeart.source.__all__` contains exactly these four names. Import shared types
from `codeart.contracts`; never import `codeart._source_lexer` or
`codeart._source_worker` from another owner's module.

## Input limits

One function definition, no `main`, no top-level declarations, no other
functions. Parameters, automatic locals, `goto` labels and recursion are inside
the supported scope. Each rejection uses a shared `ErrorCode` and, when the
position is known, a one-based line and column.

| Input | Result | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Printable ASCII `0x20`–`0x7E`, LF, CRLF, lone CR, tab outside tokens | accepted | – |
| Non-ASCII character or control character (`0x00`–`0x1F`, `0x7F`) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | original line and column of the character |
| Real tab inside a token | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | token start |
| Backslash-newline (line splice) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the backslash |
| Trigraph (`??=` …) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the `?` |
| Preprocessing directive (`#`, `%:`) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the directive token |
| Predefined macro name from the table (`__LINE__`, `__FILE__`, `__COUNTER__`, …) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the identifier |
| Any other implementation macro (`__INT_MAX__`, `__BYTE_ORDER__`, …) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the macro instantiation |
| Function-name builtin (`__func__`, `__FUNCTION__`, `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the identifier |
| GNU extension keyword (`__asm__`, `__attribute__`, `__extension__`, `__int128`, …) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the keyword |
| Static local variable (including `static const`) | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | the declaration |
| External function, external object, `extern` declaration | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` | first reference or declaration |
| More than one definition, or a non-function top-level declaration | `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE` / `INVALID_SOURCE` | the offending node |
| Syntax error under `-std=c11 -pedantic-errors` | `INVALID_SOURCE` | first compiler error |
| Input that parses but fails object compilation | `INVALID_SOURCE` | first `input.c:line:column` in the compiler output |
| Missing compiler or missing libclang | `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` | – |
| Analysis or compilation beyond the stage budget | `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT` | – |

Two details matter for the rest of the team:

- Macro detection does not depend on searching for `#`. The name table is
  checked on raw identifier tokens, so `int f(void){return __LINE__;}` is
  rejected with a location even though the text contains no directive.
- A name is only treated as an extension when libclang lexes it as a keyword.
  `int typeof = 1;` is legal C11 and stays accepted, while `typeof(1) x;` is
  rejected by the reference check.

Macro names inside comments and string literals are ordinary text: they are
lexed as `COMMENT` and `STRING_LITERAL`, so `"__LINE__"` and
`/* __FILE__ */` are accepted. Escaped spellings such as `"a\tb"` keep their
raw text and their width is `len(spelling)`.

## Character and line rules

- `original_source` is retained byte for byte. `normalized_source` replaces CRLF
  and lone CR with LF; token positions stay on the original line and column.
- A virtual final LF is added for parsing and object compilation when the input
  does not end with a newline. Nothing is added to the returned model.
- Comments are lexed first, then treated as whitespace by the caller. A
  comment's own spelling is preserved with normalized newlines.
- A tab outside tokens is accepted and reported at its original character
  index; a tab inside a token is rejected.

## The `can_join` decision

`can_join(run_tokens, next_token, profile)` concatenates the spellings of the
current run and the candidate, re-lexes that text with the same flags, and
compares the result with the expected `(kind, spelling)` pairs. Consequences:

- `f` + `(` joins; `a` + `)` joins; `)` + `{` joins.
- `+` + `+`, `/` + `*`, `/` + `/`, `<` + `<`, `-` + `>` do not join: they would
  form one token.
- Three independent `.` tokens are rejected as a run, not pair by pair.
- `1` + `.` and `L` + `"a"` do not join: the concatenation is a different token.
- An empty run is always joinable; an empty spelling is a programming error.

Results are cached in the parent process by expected tokens, compiler flags and
lexer timeout. Cache misses share one serialized child (`LexWorker`) with a
single libclang index, bounded wait and a kill-and-restart path. C still checks
its own context around every join decision; `can_join` itself is a local lexical
helper, not a schedulable stage.

## Process and dependency boundary

A and E share the public process module `codeart.procutil`. A imports
`run_command`, `BuildSession`, `stop_process` and the stop exceptions from it;
`_verification_process` is a compatibility shim and is not imported by any
module in the package. `tests/test_module_boundaries.py` fails if a private
cross-owner import returns, or if `codeart.procutil.__all__` loses a name A uses.

All children start in their own session on POSIX, run under the caller's
`RunContext`, and are killed and reaped by the caller on cancellation or
timeout. The lexer child never outlives the parent: `LexWorker` registers an
`atexit` close and reaps a hung worker before starting the next one.

## Budget and cancellation

`analyze_source` builds an internal context whose deadline is the smaller of the
caller's deadline and `profile.lex_timeout`, so lexing and the object build
share one analysis budget. A cancelled pipeline raises `StageError(CANCELLED)`;
an expired deadline raises `StageError(PIPELINE_TIMEOUT)`; an exhausted analysis
budget raises `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT`. The diagnostics keep the code and stage, so F
can display them without parsing text.

## Tests and evidence

```sh
python -m pytest -q tests/test_source.py tests/test_source_lexer.py \
  tests/test_source_boundaries.py tests/test_module_boundaries.py
python -m scripts.check_source_diagnostics --output docs/reports/a_source/A_diagnostics.json
```

`tests/test_source.py` keeps the shared-contract, pipeline and cancellation
cases; `tests/test_source_lexer.py` covers worker reuse and restart;
`tests/test_source_boundaries.py` covers input limits, macro and extension
handling, CRLF positions, compiler-error locations and every `can_join`
boundary; `tests/test_module_boundaries.py` guards the A/E import boundary.
`scripts/check_source_diagnostics.py` writes the ten documented demonstration
cases with their codes and positions, and exits nonzero if one changes.
See [the Part A completion checks](../reports/A_source.md) for the recorded run.

## Known limits

- The predefined-macro table is a fixed list. A macro that is neither in the
  table nor expanded as a visible instantiation would surface as an undeclared
  reference instead; the code is still `UNSUPPORTED_SOURCE`, the message differs.
- Extension rejection is keyword-based. An extension that this compiler lexes as
  an ordinary identifier (for example `typeof` written by itself) is caught by
  the reference check rather than by the keyword rule.
- `can_join` decides lexical safety only. It does not prove that the resulting
  layout keeps comments, holes or required separators intact; E's re-lex of the
  complete output remains the final check.
- A tab outside tokens is preserved as a character but the layout stage never
  emits tabs; the generated source uses spaces only.
